14/N,illum,"Assessment of the crown illumination index, measured as a number between 1-5, only measured in the FALL. Method taken from Dawkins and Field 1978 (see updated dendrometer protocol). 
5 = crown completely exposed (to vertical light and to lateral light within the 90 degree inverted cone encompassing the crown)
4 = full overhead light (>=90% of the vertical projection of the crown exposed to vertical light; later light blocked within some or all of the 90 degree inverted cone encompassing the crown)
3 = some overhead light (10-90% of the vertical project of the crown exposed to vertical light)
2 = lateral light (<10% of the vertical project of the crown exposed to vertical light; crown lit laterally)
1 = no direct light (crown not lit directly either vertically or laterally)",numeric (integer),
15/O,crown.condition,"Assessment of the crown condition, given as a number for crown health, and only measured in the FALL. The 4-point crown condition scale has the following categories:
4 = 75-100% of the crown is intact (no or few branches lost)
3 = 50-75% of the crown is intact
2 = 25-50% of the crown is intact
1 = 0-25% of the crown is intact (most of the crown is gone).
This comes from the updated dendrometer protocol (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kCG22EAEnOVxw9Z-cPPvrHIzvRFE-j0U7anTmhJbkqM/edit).",numeric (integer),
16/P,crown.position,"Assessment of the crown position, given as a qualifier, and only measured in the FALL. The position scale has the following categories:

Dominant (D) = crown above the general level of the canopy
Codominant (C) = crown within the general level of the canopy
Intermediate (I) = shorter than general canopy level, but illuminated from above
Suppressed (S) = shorter than the canopy level, receiving no illumination from above
