# SCBI crown position

The data_entry_form.csv file has all trees that are cored, in addition to trees in the biannual dendroband survey (and by extension, the intraannual). 
- This file was created combining data form dendrobands and cored trees and it is kept in this [repo](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/tree-growth-and-productivity/tree/master/dendro_cored_full).
- As a reminder, dbh is in mm

Protocol for determining crown position is based on [Jennings 1999](https://academic.oup.com/forestry/article/72/1/59/589132) pages 69-70.
