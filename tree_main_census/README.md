# SCBI Tree census

## Overview 
This [folder](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/SCBI-ForestGEO-Data/tree/master/tree_main_census/data) contains the _R Analytical tables_ for census 1 (2008), census 2 (2013), and census 3 (2018) at SCBI (also available in .csv format). Census 4 (2023) is in a separate repository: [20203census](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/2023census).


R tables are created once all data have been checked and corrected after a tree survey is finished in a ForestGEO plot. Each plot have a `stem table` per census. This is the most convenient format for analyzing census data using R functions from the ForestGEO R Package available [here](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/).

## Sampling location

## Species

List of tagged tree species can be found [here](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/SCBI-ForestGEO-Data/blob/master/tree_main_census/data/census-csv-files/scbi.spptable.csv).

A more comprehensive list of species with ecological and botanical data for the plot is found [here](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/SCBI-ForestGEO-Data/tree/master/species_lists/Tree%20ecology)


## Sampling dates

## Protocols

See [Bourg et al. 2013](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/13-0010.1/full) for protocols at SCBI and [Condit 1998](https://forestgeo.si.edu/sites/default/files/condit_1998_censusplotsmethodsbook.pdf) for original protocols at CTFS-ForestGEO plots.

## Metadata

Check metadata and other details for [full table](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/SCBI-ForestGEO-Data/blob/master/tree_main_census/metadata/CTFS_R_FORMATTED_DATA_TABLES_Full.pdf) and [stem table](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/SCBI-ForestGEO-Data/blob/master/tree_main_census/metadata/CTFS_R_FORMATTED_DATA_TABLES_Stem.pdf).

## Data version
Data in this repository were last updated in June 28, 2019.

## Data use

The offical master version for all censuses at this site resides in the [ForestGEO Portal](http://ctfs.si.edu/datarequest/index.php/main). If you plan to publish work using these data please complete the request form for SCBI tree data [here](http://ctfs.si.edu/datarequest/index.php/request/form/9). This will ensure that you have the latest data version and allow us to track data usage.

Note that data for Census 1 at SCBI is also published in [Bourg et al. 2013](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/13-0010.1/full), but subsequent corrections are recorded in the master version.
