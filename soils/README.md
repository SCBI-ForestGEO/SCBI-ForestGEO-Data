# SCBI soil data

This folder contains soil data collected by Ben Turner in 2011 at SCBI (former CRC). Also included are protocols and maps created in the past for SCBI plot.


Notes:

- The txt files are the kriged means for each grid square. The excel is the raw data. I am also attaching some of the maps.

- Carbon data might be a bit complicated but let [Ben] know any questions and I can help identify specific requirements. The carbon data was used by Matt Craig (Rich Phillips student) for a recent (in 2019) paper.
 
- The data from all the plots is going online eventually – it’s currently all in a dropbox folder – so not sure whether it’s a good idea to have multiple copies of it. However, if Stuart is happy with it then it’s fine by me to post it on github.


Authorship:
 
For authorship, there are no conditions, although most (but not all) people tend to include me [Ben Turner] in publications, especially when they need some input on the soils side of things anyway.  CTFS people tend to be inclusive, but if it’s something way out of my field that I can’t contribute to intellectually, or if it’s some marginal use of the soil data, then in those cases there’d probably be no need to include me.
