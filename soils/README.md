# SCBI soil data

This folder contains soil data collected at SCBI (a.k.a. "CRC" in some file names) in 2011 (collected by B. Turner, who is no longer affiliated with Smithsonian or ForestGEO). Also included are protocols and maps created in the past for SCBI plot.


Notes:

- The txt files are the kriged means for each grid square. 
- The excel file contains the raw data. 
- The maps folder includes maps.

- Carbon data might be a bit complicated. The carbon data was used in [Craig et al. 2018, *GCB*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.14132).
