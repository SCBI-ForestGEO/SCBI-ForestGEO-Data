This is an original measurement file passed to K. Anderson-Teixeira by Jennifer McGarvey & Jonathan Thompson in April 2013. It contains all cored trees (including those with cores that were rejected). It was created mainly by Jennifer McGarvey.

from Jennifer:

"There are 1126 records total, of which 295 cores were never measured, 87 are for trees that were dead and so no cores were collected (indicated by a NA in the datafile), and 20 are duplicate cores, leaving 724 unique cores that we have a ring count and measurement for."
