# Purpose: Calculate ANPP, total and per species, for 1cm threshold and 10 cm threshold without growth rate outliers
# To identify and deal with outliers,  group trees into size bins 1-5cm, 5-10cm, 10-50cm, and >50cm. Throw out any measurements where the calculated growth rate is more than 4 std outside the mean for the size bin. Replace these with the mean.
